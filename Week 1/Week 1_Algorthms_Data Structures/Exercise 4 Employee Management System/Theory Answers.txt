Q Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages ?
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory where each element can be accessed using its index.
They provide fast access to elements since the index can be calculated directly.

Advantages:
Fast Access: O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
Memory Efficiency: Fixed size, allocated at creation.

Q Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete)?
Time Complexity of Operations:
- Add: O(1) if adding at the end, O(n) if resizing is needed.
- Search: O(n) in the worst case.
- Traverse: O(n).
- Delete: O(n) due to shifting elements.

Q Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them?
- Fixed size can lead to wasted memory or insufficient space.
- Costly operations for insertion and deletion.
