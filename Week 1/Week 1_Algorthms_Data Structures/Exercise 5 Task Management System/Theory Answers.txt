Q Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)?

Types of Linked Lists:

- Singly Linked List:
Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Advantages: Simple to implement, efficient for sequential access and insertions/deletions at the head.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for random access and cannot traverse backward.

- Doubly Linked List:
Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Advantages: Can traverse in both directions, efficient for insertions/deletions from both ends.
Disadvantages: More memory usage due to extra pointers, slightly more complex to implement.

Q Analyze the time complexity of each operation?
Add: O(1) if adding at the head, O(n) if adding at the end or a specific position.
Search: O(n) in the worst case.
Traverse: O(n).
Delete: O(n) to find the element, O(1) for deletion once found.

Q Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data?
- Dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions at the head.
- No need for resizing as in arrays.
