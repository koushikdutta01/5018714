Q Explain linear search and binary search algorithms ?

Linear Search:
Sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
Advantages: Simple to implement, does not require the list to be sorted.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for large lists (O(n) time complexity).

Binary Search:
Efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Advantages: More efficient than linear search for large lists (O(log n) time complexity).
Disadvantages: Requires the list to be sorted

Q Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search ?
Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)

Q Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order?
- Use linear search for small or unsorted lists.
- Use binary search for large, sorted lists to take advantage of the reduced time complexity.
